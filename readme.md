### Load additional scripts

In practice, most scripts are loaded via `Modernizr.load`. But in some cases, backend developers need to add additional scripts depending on jQuery. So that to load additional scripts, create script tag with 'data-src' attribute instead of 'src'.

```HTML
<script data-src="path/to/script.js"></script>
```

### Available gulp task

| task      | description  |
|---        |---|
| `gulp`   | Run all main tasks such as SCSS compiling, image optimization, etc once.  |
| `gulp watch`   | Run default task while watching changed files.   |
| `gulp build`   | Clear assets folder and regenerate fresh pristine assets directory along with ready to production assets.  |
| `gulp livereload`   | Enable livereload development. Run separately with `gulp watch`  |
